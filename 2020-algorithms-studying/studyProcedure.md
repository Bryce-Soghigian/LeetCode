Study Guide

Carefully read each word of the problem statements and look for hints about solving patterns. For example, the number of ways for a task indicates DP, string transformation with dictionary indicates BFS / DFS / Trie, looking for duplicate or unique elements indicates hashing or bit manipulation, parsing indicates the use of stack. If you need a compiled list of tricks and indicators of when to use what, you may check out the book Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook. Thanks /u/ShadowOfOrion for the tip.

When you have a rough idea about the direction, you are half way to go. Try to at least implement a suboptimal solution. It is okay that yours is not optimal, people spent much effort to polish their solutions to optimize them.

Once you have a suboptimal solution, you may head over to the top solutions to learn what you can improve and any alternative methods to solve the same problem.

Try to thoroughly understand the thought process and implement the optimal solutions based on your understanding without looking at any hints.

Once you are comfortable with seeing through the problem patterns, it is time for the grand challenges.
